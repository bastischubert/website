## Harnessing the potential of Prometheus Agent mode

Speaker(s): [M Viswanath Sai](../../speakers/m-viswanath-sai) & [S Ashwin](../../speakers/s-ashwin)

We already have a lot of Prometheus Agent mode "StatefulSet vs DaemonSet deployment model" comparisons, ironically however, choosing between StatefulSet and DaemonSet models can be quite confusing due to the lack of solid, data-backed advice. Our session aims to clear the air around this situation by providing practical, data backed insights based on real-world scenarios.

We'll share empirical findings that show where each deployment model shines, where they are not advisable to use etc., so that the audience can make informed decisions. We will also explore "hybrid deployment" approaches that combine both models, something that is being experimented with, at Prometheus-Operator. This offers new ways to scale and ensure reliabilityâ€”an approach not widely discussed.

Alongside practical tips, we'll narrate the story of how Agent mode came to be, it's raise to monitoring stardom, and how it has evolved to meet different operational needs.

Join us for a straightforward and engaging session that combines real data with a compelling narrative, giving you practical takeaways and a deeper understanding of Prometheus Agent deployments.
