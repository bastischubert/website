## The Key to Go Efficiency is Just a Few Prometheus Metrics Away!

Go Runtime is a key component that manages goroutines, memory allocations and garbage collection. It also tracks useful information about performance and state of your Go application, including Prometheus server itself. Do you know how to collect and use them on the scale? Do you know why Prometheus added the reloadable “runtime.gogc” configuration in a recent version? Have you heard about a completely new runtime/metrics package released in Go 1.16?
In this talk, Arianna (Go developer and Prometheus client_golang contributor) will bring you up to speed on using Prometheus metrics from Go Runtime! The audience will learn the importance and best practices of collecting Go Runtime metrics with Prometheus client_golang, especially with the new Go runtime/metrics package. However, emphasis will be made on gaining actionable insights from specific metrics, discussing the bottlenecks it can detect and common optimizations to solve those!
Join us to learn how to leverage Go Runtime metrics to build faster, more reliable Go applications and use Prometheus server more efficiently on the way!
