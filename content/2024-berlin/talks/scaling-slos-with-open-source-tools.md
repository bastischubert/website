## Scaling SLOs with open source tools

Defining Service Level Objectives and Service Level Indicators is a really important aspect of implementing SRE. Through service metrics (SLOs, SLIs, Error Budgets), SRE can help us measure our system’s performance and improve customer experience. They not only enable your teams to monitor and plan around reliability, but can also be early predictors of customer satisfaction, NPS, churn rates, and more. 

With the rise of cloud native technologies, it has become more and more relevant to automate our observability, extending it to an SLO-as-code model. In this session we’ll see how SLOs have evolved and can be used in a Cloud Native world. We’ll then explore how technologies like Kubernetes and Prometheus can help us scale SLOs, while promoting best practices and standards using Observability as code. Finally, we’ll see how to put all these together with Jenkins and Rancher, to operationalize error budgets
