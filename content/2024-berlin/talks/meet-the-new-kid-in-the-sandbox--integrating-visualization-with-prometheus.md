## Meet the New Kid in the Sandbox - Integrating Visualization with Prometheus

Speaker(s): [Eric D. Schabell](../../speakers/eric-d-schabell)

When you jump in the CNCF Sandbox you will soon (may be approved by the time you see this) meet the new kid, a visualization and dashboards project called Perses. This session will provide attendees with the basics to get started with integrating Prometheus, PromQL, and more with Perses. A journey will be taken from zero to beautiful visualizations seamlessly integrated with Prometheus. This session leaves the attendees with hands-on self-paced workshop content to head home and dive right in to creating their first visualizations and integrations with Prometheus and Perses!
