I am an Engineering undergrad student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi, majoring in Metallurgical Engineering. I started dabbling with software development as a small passion during my freshman year and it has now become a significant part of my life. I'm living my best life, constantly learning something new and exciting, doing something I genuinely enjoy.
