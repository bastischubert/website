Working at MariaDB Corporation

During my 15 years of working experience, I've been working as an infrastructure engineer, a DBA, a cloud engineer, and now - DevOps/SRE. I am currently Staff SRE at MariaDB Enterprise building and maintaining the next-level DBaaS platform SkySQL.
My work passions are - all things open-source and CNCF. I've been working with cloud orchestration and Kubernetes in particular for more than 6 years now and this reinvigorated my career. Long live Prometheus!
