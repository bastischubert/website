Working at solo.io

Krisztian is enthusiastic about observability and cloud infrastructures. He's now working at Solo.io as an engineer. Previously, he was working at LastPass as senior DevOps/SRE engineer. Krisztian is building a self hosted blog on top of Istio in his spare time. The main topics of the blog are aligned with his interests while he is also using the platform to share operational anecdotes on running one of the most "over-engineered" blog out there.
