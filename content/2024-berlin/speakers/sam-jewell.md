Working at Grafana Labs

I have been using Prometheus and Grafana for over three years, mostly for analytics.

I’m passionate about all things Querying:
- Pushing the limits of query languages such as PromQL in their present form
- Working on a Semantic-Layers for Prometheus, to add labels from Info Metrics by automagically joining them to the query behind the scenes
- Building SQL and “NoQL” experiences into Grafana, to enable powerful transforms and joins of data from a vast range of datasources in one place

I love talking about these projects, so please come and grab me!
