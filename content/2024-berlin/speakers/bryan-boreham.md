Working at Grafana Labs

Bryan Boreham is a Distinguished Engineer at Grafana Labs, working on highly scalable storage for metrics, logs and traces.

After first getting into programming as a kid, creating a video game called "Splat", Bryan's career has ranged from charting pie sales at a bakery to real-time pricing of billion-dollar bond trades. A contributor to many Open Source projects since 1988, Bryan is a member of the Prometheus team and previous maintainer of CNCF Cortex and CNI projects. Outside of work he is a father, a helicopter pilot, and can cook a mean risotto primavera.
