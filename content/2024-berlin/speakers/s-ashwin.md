I'm an engineering student at IIT-BHU, majoring in metallurgy, but my heart truly lies in software engineering. I find solving coding challenges exhilarating, and I thrive on engaging in conversations about innovative topics with others. Currently, I am a mentee with Prometheus-Operator through GSoC, where I am dedicated to enhancing the website and documentation. I've developed a strong interest in observability and I'm currently diving deep into it.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll catch me jamming to music, singing my heart out, or binge-watching movies. Let's connect and share our passion for innovation!
