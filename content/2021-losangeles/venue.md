Important: The Linux Foundation will never reach out to attendees by phone to
make hotel reservations for our conferences. Please be advised that the most
secure way to book in our discounted room block is by using the direct booking
link provided below or by calling the hotel directly. If you receive a phone
call or email from someone claiming to be with The Linux Foundation or the hotel
and they attempt to sell you a hotel room, please email us at
[housing@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:housing@linuxfoundation.org).

Information on conference hotel blocks will be available in Summer 2021.
