## Augustin Husson

Working at Amadeus

Principal engineer at Amadeus and as a Prometheus maintainer, I’m currently focusing on how we can share UI components between the different UI that are in the Prometheus ecosystem. I’m also working in a new open source project called Perses that aims to be a GitOps friendly standard dashboard visualisation tool for Prometheus.
I started to contribute to Prometheus by creating the PromQL editor with Julius Volz. It is today available in the Prometheus console and should help you to write easier PromQL query.
When I’m not trying to redo the world, I’m more likely trying to climb a high mountain to find the sun and the fresh air.
