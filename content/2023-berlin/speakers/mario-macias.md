## Mario Macias

Working at Grafana Labs

I love programming since I was 12 years old. I’m a software engineer with 20 years of experience. During that time, I’ve been a scientific researcher, Ph.D student, university teacher, backend developer, and book writer. During the last 7 years I've focused on monitoring and observability at different layers.
