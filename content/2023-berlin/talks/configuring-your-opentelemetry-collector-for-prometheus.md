## Configuring your OpenTelemetry collector for Prometheus

Speaker(s): [Matej Gera](../../speakers/matej-gera)

Although OpenTelemetry has been rising in popularity as a solution for collecting observability signals, Prometheus and its exposition format is not going anywhere. Whether the reason you are switching to OpenTelemetry is due to its expanded functionality, organizational reasons, or youâ€™re just curious, this talk will give you a basis for understanding how to configure the Prometheus receiver and exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector and what to look out for. The presenter will also explain how to bring your existing Prometheus Operator setup and leverage it for metrics collection with the OpenTelemetry Operator.
