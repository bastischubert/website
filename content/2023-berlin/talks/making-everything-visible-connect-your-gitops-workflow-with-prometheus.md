## Making everything visible - Connect your GitOps workflow with Promethus

Speaker(s): [Siddhant Khisty](../../speakers/siddhant-khisty) & [Aakansha Priya](../../speakers/aakansha-priya)

GitOps has become one of the industry's best practices as it offers a number of benefits in terms of security, scalability, collaboration and maintaining a single source of truth. While a simple GitOps workflow using ArgoCD or Flux will be sufficent for a simple application, the same might not ring true for larger applications that have thousands of microservices.

Moreover, if you have multiple applications on the same cluster or group of clusters, it becomes even more important to have a good monitoring practice. This can help detect security attacks such as DDOS attacks, performance bottlenecks which can then be improved, and lets you gain insights into your application's state which in turn can help optimize it even further.

In this talk, we will talk about GitOps, its benefits, in what cases you might want to consider having a monitoring solution along with your GitOps workflow, and what benefits you can get out of it. By the end of this presentation, attendees will have a clear understanding of the need for good observability systems, and learn how to integrate it with a GitOps pipeline.
