## Observing the world's most famous 3D print farm

Speaker(s): [Pavel Strobl](../../speakers/pavel-strobl)

Using Prometheus in Cloud Native is obvious. Using it in IT is a sane default. But what if you have a spleen for observing the real, physical world?

Prusa Research is likely the best-known 3D printer manufacturer in the maker scene, and it started to aggressively modernize their software side. Join us on an end user journey of how Prometheus sits at the center of Prusa's new approach. From the shop to printables.com (of of the best known 3D print file repositories) all the way to individual printers and likely the best-known 3D print farm on Earth, it all ties back to Prometheus.
